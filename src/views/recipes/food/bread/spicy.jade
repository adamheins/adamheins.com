      p.
        A variation on #[a(href="/recipes/food/bread/basic") basic bread] that
        adds a nice kick of spice. I would recommend using this bread for
        dipping in something like hummus or cheese, or for use in a hearty
        sandwich in need of an extra kick.

        li Add warm water to bowl.
        li Add yeast to bowl. Stir until dissolved.
        li.
          Add salt, sugar, oil, 2 tsp cayenne powder, and 3 cups flour to the
          bowl. Stir until mixed.
        li.
          Continue adding and mixing flour, half a cup at a time, until you
          have a soft dough.
        li Place dough on a lightly-floured surface.
        li Knead the dough for 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary.
        li.
          Place the dough in a greased bowl, flip the dough once to grease the
          top.
        li.
          Cover the bowl with a lightly-moistened cloth. Leave for 1&frac12;
          hours. The dough should have approximately doubled in size after
          this period.
        li.
          Punch the dough down. Remove from the bowl and place on a
          lightly-floured surface.
        li.
          Divide the dough into two pieces and flatten each into roughly the
          shape of a long rectangle.
        li.
          Create spice mix. Combine 2 tsp cayenne powder, 2 tbsp ground cayenne
          pepper, and &frac12; tsp black pepper in a small mixing bowl. Mix
          thoroughly.
        li.
          Generously sprinkle the mixture on the top surface of each piece of
          dough. Once the top is covered, roll each piece of dough into the
          shape of a loaf.
        li Spray each pan and place a loaf into each.
        li Top each loaf with a sprinkle of cayenne powder.
        li.
          Cover each pan with a damp cloth and leave for 40 minutes to rise
          further.
        li Bake for 30-35 minutes at 375&#176;F.
        li Remove loaves from pans and let cool for 20-30 minutes.
