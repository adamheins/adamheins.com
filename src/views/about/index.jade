    h3 Introduction
    p.
      My name is Adam. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo
      studying Mechatronics Engineering. I'm particularly interested in
      computer science, math and robotics. I currently work at
      #[a(href="https://www.pebble.com") Pebble] on the firmware team.
    h3 Technical Background
    p.
      I like to explore new technologies and put them to use. I enjoy the
      challenge of solving difficult problems and creating interesting things.
      I've had experience working with embedded systems, enterprise, desktop,
      and the web. I'm also a member of Waterloo's robotics team. I've created
      a number of side projects, with a particular focus on math- and
      systems-related tasks. Most of them are open-source and can be viewed on
      #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins") GitHub]. For more details, see
      my #[a(href="/resume") résumé].
    h3 Other Interests and Activities
    p.
      I like hiking, running, cycling, and other outdoor activities. I try to
      explore and do new things as much as I can. I also enjoy tinkering
      with electronics, reading, and writing.
