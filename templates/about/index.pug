          I finished my undergrad in Mechatronics Engineering at the University
          of Waterloo in April 2017. I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. as a member
          of the #[a(href="http://dynsyslab.org") Dynamic Systems Lab] at the
          University of Toronto, researching safe probabilistic learning for
          robots.

          I've written a fair bit of code, much of which you can find on
          #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins") GitHub]. Some of my other
          current hobbies include running, climbing, cooking, and reading.

          The best way to get in touch with me is through
          #[a(href="mailto:mail@adamheins.com") email].
