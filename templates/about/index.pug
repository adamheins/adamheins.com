          I completed a B.A.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering at the University
          of Waterloo in April 2017. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the
          #[a(href="http://dynsyslab.org") Dynamic Systems Lab] at the
          University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, researching
          safe, probabilistic learning for robots.

          I've written a fair bit of code, much of which you can find on
          #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins") GitHub]. Some of my other
          current hobbies include running, climbing, cooking, and reading.
