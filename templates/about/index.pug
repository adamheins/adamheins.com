        My name is Adam. I'm a fourth-year student at the University of
        Waterloo studying Mechatronics Engineering. I'm particularly
        interested in embedded systems and robotics.

        I enjoy the challenge of solving difficult problems and creating
        interesting things. I've had experience working with embedded
        systems, enterprise, desktop, and the web. You can check out many of
        my projects on #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins") GitHub].  For
        more details, see my #[a(href="/resume") résumé].
      p.
        My current hobbies include running, cooking, and reading. I enjoy
        coffee and classical music.
