      description:
        We present a novel learning control method for Lagrangian systems that
        combines ideas from robust control with Gaussian process regression
        (GPR). The main idea is to use GPR to learn an upper bound on the
        uncertainty in the system online, which is then used in a robust
        controller. We prove that the learned upper bound is correct with high
        probability. Further, we verify the approach experimentally on a 6
        degree-of-freedom UR10 industrial manipulator.

        A mobile robot capable of navigating the boiler room of a nuclear power
        plant and autonomously performing pipe thickness measurements and
        collection of other relevant data. Engineering Capstone project. I
        focused largely on the software systems, particularly the vision system
        and interface to the robot arm.

      description:
        A mobile robot that autonomously traverses an obstacle course,
        including ascending and descending a ramp and locating a variable end
        point. Developed as part of the MTE 380 design project course at the
        University of Waterloo. I worked primarily on the robot's software,
        including the signal processing, movement, and state machine.
