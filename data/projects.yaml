        A mobile robot capable of navigating the boiler room of a nuclear power
        plant and autonomously performing pipe thickness measurements and
        collection of other relevant data. Engineering Capstone project. I
        focused largely on the software systems, particularly the vision system
        and interface to the robot arm.
