        A mobile robot capable of navigating the boiler room of a nuclear power
        plant and autonomously performing pipe thickness measurements and
        collection of other relevant data. Engineering Capstone project. I
        focused largely on the software systems, particularly the vision system
        and interface to the robot arm.

      description:
        A mobile robot that autonomously traverses an obstacle course,
        including ascending and descending a ramp and locating a variable end
        point. Developed as part of the MTE 380 design project course at the
        University of Waterloo. I worked primarily on the robot's software,
        including the signal processing, movement, and state machine.
