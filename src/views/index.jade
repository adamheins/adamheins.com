    h2 The Sandbox
    p.
      The sandbox is a place where I try out cool web things I'm working on
      that aren't quite ready or large enough to be their own project.
      Prototypes and experiments are common here.
    .sandbox
      canvas#dragon
    p.
      The first program to demo here is an interactive implementation of the
      dragon fractal curve. Press the #[span.emphasized right arrow key] to
      increase the fractal detail and the #[span.emphasized left arrow key] to
      reduce it. Alternatively, clicking on the fractal's canvas will also
      increase the fractal detail. The source can be found
      #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins/fractals/tree/master/dragon") here].
