        li.
          Prepare the pumpkin. Cut off the top, like you would if you were
          carving a jack-o'-lantern. Remove all of the seeds and insides.
        li Cut bread into &frac12-inch cubes.
        li.
          Fill pumpkin with bread cubes, almonds, walnuts, raisins, and other
          desired mixins. Ensure that mixins are evenly distributed amongst the
          bread cubes.
        li.
          Prepare the custard. Beat eggs and add cream, brown sugar, maple
          syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Stir until well-mixed.
        li.
          Pour custard into the pumpkin. You want all of the bread cubes to be
          well-soaked, but not drowning in liquid.
        li.
          Place the top back on the pumpkin and place on baking sheet lined
          with parchment paper.
        li.
          Bake at 350&degF for about 90 minutes. Baking time may vary depending
          on size of the pumpkin. Dish is about done when a nice can easily
          pierce the pumpkin's flesh.
        li.
          Serve free-standing. Cut slices directly out of the pumpkin.

      h2 Notes
      p.
        This recipe lists almonds, walnuts, and raisins as mixins. However,
        feel free to exclude these or add other items as well, such as fruit.
      p.
        The custard uses both brown sugar and maple syrup for sweetening. I
        like maple, but one can omit the maple syrup and just use more brown
        sugar. Even white sugar is fine.
