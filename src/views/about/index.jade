          My name is Adam. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo
          studying Mechatronics Engineering. I'm particularly interested in
          embedded systems and robotics. I most recently interned at
          #[a(href="https://www.pebble.com") Pebble] on the firmware team. I
          will be joining #[a(href="https://nest.com") Nest] as an intern on
          the Embedded Applications team in the summer.

          I enjoy the challenge of solving difficult problems and creating
          interesting things.  I've had experience working with embedded
          systems, enterprise, desktop, and the web. You can check out many of
          my projects on #[a(href="https://github.com/adamheins") GitHub].  For
          more details, see my #[a(href="/resume") résumé].

          I enjoy travel and adventure. I like hiking, running,
          cycling, and other outdoor activities. I also enjoy reading, writing,
          and speaking. I'm thoroughly fond of black coffee. Sometimes I cook.
