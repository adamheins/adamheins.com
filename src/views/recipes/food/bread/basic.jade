        li Add warm water to bowl.
        li Add yeast to bowl. Stir until dissolved.
        li.
          Add salt, 3 tbsp sugar, oil, and 3 cups flour to the bowl. Stir until
          mixed.
        li.
          Continue adding and mixing flour, half a cup at a time, until you
          have a soft dough.
        li Place dough on a lightly-floured surface.
        li Knead the dough for 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary.
        li.
          Place the dough in a greased bowl, flip the dough once to grease the
          top.
        li.
          Cover the bowl with a lightly-moistened cloth. Leave for 1&frac12;
          hours. The dough should have approximately doubled in size after
          this period.
        li.
          Punch the dough down. Remove from the bowl and place on a
          lightly-floured surface.

        li Spray each pan and place a loaf into each.
